# 6. Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

## Context
The homelab will run containerized applications and services. We need a tool for:
- Managing container deployments, scaling, and monitoring.
- Providing networking and storage abstractions.

## Decision
We will use **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.

## Rationale
1. **Orchestration Features**:
   - Kubernetes provides declarative deployments, auto-scaling, self-healing, and service discovery.
2. **Ecosystem**:
   - Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration, with robust tooling and community support.
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Kubernetes can be deployed on Proxmox VMs, allowing seamless integration with the homelab.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Kubernetes is future-proof for expanding workloads or distributed setups.

## Consequences
- Kubernetes workloads will be defined using manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize.
- Additional tools (e.g., `kubeadm`, `k3s`) will be needed to set up the Kubernetes cluster.
- The team must maintain Kubernetes configurations and monitor cluster health.
